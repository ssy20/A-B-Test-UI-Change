# A-B-Test-UI-Change-

## Project Description 
An e-commerce site want to test whether implementing standardized Spanish translation versus localized translation has any effect on the conversion rate. They run an A/B test where each Spanish-speaking country would have its own translation written by a local. 

## Hypothesis
Implementing a localized Spanish translation for each Spanish-speaking country will increase conversion rate. 

## Experiment 
Randomly split users in Spanish-speaking countries into test group and control group. The control group will see the original standardized Spanish translation and the test group will see the localized version of the website. 

## Metric 
Conversion: the number of users who signed up for the website. 

## Result
Users in Argentina and Uruguay are more lilely to be assigned to test group than control group. After excluding users from these two countries, we don't have enough data to draw a significant conclusion.
